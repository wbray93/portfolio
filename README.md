# portfolio
My portfolio that I am working on. I am developing it as I learn to code and plan to constantly update and make it as nice and responsive and fluid as possible. It will be where I showcase all of my projects as well as eventually as I learn to do it have a functional built in blog where I talk about my daily life and journey both as a person and a developer.
